    <ul class="aboutMe">I started to take a liking on Information and Technology when I was in Primary school. It was Iron Man who piqued my interest in the field of information and Technology and led me to take courses on programming lessons outside of curriculum hours. The lessons taught me about the basics of programming which consists of basic Python programming and web programming. From there, they introduced me to a hackathon called CodeXtreme Apps in which I made a website catering to the Karang guni to make it easier for them to find recyclables that others donate</ul>
