    <p class="About">For the first 2 years of secondary school, I did not think much of my academics and therefore my grades were mediocre. However, my teachers told me that they saw potential that was inside me and told me if I worked hard enough, I could get desirable grades. Thus, I told myself that I should not be lazing around anymore as my national examinations were nearing. This led me to push myself to limits that I have never reached before and step out of my comfort zone as I revised for my upcoming Secondary 3 examinations. I got rid of my bad habits and started developing good habits of studying and gave myself ample time to rest. Overall, I think that this experience showed me that anything is possible if I just worked hard enough.</p>
